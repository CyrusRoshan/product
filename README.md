###A simple product-oriented website template
####Production Complete!

___

Product is a mobile-friendly website template designed to have an intuitive feel and simple and smooth UX/UI. It is designed for startups or other companies who are trying to showcase a single (you guessed it) product. 

It's designed in order to require as little changes as possible to be done to the template. Just change the text, insert your images, and modify the coloring! Change the images and the classnames for the images from section3 to remove the animation, or add in your own custom animation.

SASS was used as a CSS preprocessor, so it will be easiest to modify the website through the .scss file.
If you're not comfortable using SASS, you can paste the .css file's contents into a CSS simplifier/formatter/optimizer and edit it from there.

The website is viewable at <a href="http://cyrusroshan.me/product">cyrusroshan.me/product</a>
